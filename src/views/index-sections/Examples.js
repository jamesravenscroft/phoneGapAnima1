              <p>Players choose their ingredients in order to craft specific potions using a single action per turn. If they have what they need, a potion may be crafted, but be aware of what other players are crafting as the ultimate goal is to turn those potions into spells. The player with the best spells (by point value) at the end of the game is the winner!</p>
